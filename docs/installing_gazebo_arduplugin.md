### Video Tutorial at https://youtu.be/m7hPyJJmWmU

## Overview 

Robot simulation is an essential tool in every roboticist's toolbox. A well-designed simulator makes it possible to rapidly test algorithms, design robots, perform regression testing, and train AI system using realistic scenarios. Gazebo offers the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. At your fingertips is a robust physics engine, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic and graphical interfaces. Best of all, Gazebo is free with a vibrant community.

## Install Gazebo plugin for APM (ArduPilot Master) :
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/khancyr/ardupilot_gazebo.git
cd ardupilot_gazebo
```
***Ubuntu 18.04 only*** checkout dev
```
git checkout dev
```
build and install plugin
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
sudo make install
```
```
echo 'source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
```
Set paths for models:
```
echo 'export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/ardupilot_gazebo/models' >> ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bashrc
```

## Run Simulator

**NOTE the iris_arducopter_runway is not currently working in gazebo11. The iq_sim worlds DO work**

In one Terminal (Terminal 1), run Gazebo:
```
gazebo --verbose ~/ardupilot_gazebo/worlds/iris_arducopter_runway.world
```

In another Terminal (Terminal 2), run SITL:
```
cd ~/ardupilot/ArduCopter/
sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter -f gazebo-iris --console
```
